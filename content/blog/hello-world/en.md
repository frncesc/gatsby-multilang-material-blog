Here's a great quote from Wikipedia on
[Romanesque art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_art).

> Romanesque art is the art of Europe from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the Gothic style
> in the 12th century, or later, depending on region. The preceding period is known as the
> Pre-Romanesque period. The term was invented by 19th-century art historians, especially for Romanesque
> architecture, which retained many basic features of Roman architectural style – most notably round-headed
> arches, but also barrel vaults, apses, and acanthus-leaf decoration – but had also developed many very
> different characteristics. In Southern France, Spain and Italy there was an architectural continuity
> with the Late Antique, but the Romanesque style was the first style to spread across the whole of
> Catholic Europe, from Sicily to Scandinavia. Romanesque art was also greatly influenced by Byzantine art,
> especially in painting, and by the anti-classical energy of the decoration of the Insular art of the
> British Isles. From these elements was forged a highly innovative and coherent style.
